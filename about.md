Seeking a position as a R&D Scientist in biotech or pharma.
 
I'm a computational physicist by training and have worked on projects ranging from Molecular Dynamics of biological systems to Quantum Monte Carlo. 
Recently I've worked on modeling gene regulatory networks of cancer to elucidate how the most aggressive cancer phenotypes are stabilized and identify potential therapeutic pathways.
