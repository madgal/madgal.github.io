I'm a computational scientist working on her bachelors. I found a love of computer science in my freshman year and haven't lost it. Since then I have made huge progress in my coding skills. Since I also love science my coding projects focus on the computational sciences. I have written code in Python, Fortran, C, and C++ and contributed to some software (most is hosted here on github). I started out with computational research on the molecular dynamics side, but have eventually made my way to the quantum mechanics side.
