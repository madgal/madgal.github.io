Right now I am trying to figure out how to use tcl scripting with Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) to streamline my process of data visualizaiton and analysis. 

I have previously written code for hydration analysis of a polymer using python. I really appreciate the ease of python's syntax and the strength of its data analysis packages. 

Most of the computer science courses I have taken I have needed to use Java for the programs so I have become fairly efficient in that language as well. The only course that didn't require Java instead required jasmin (the assembly language that runs on the JVM). My current Advanced Data Structures class is getting me familiar with C++.
