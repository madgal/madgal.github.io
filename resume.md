Research Experience
===================
**Onuchic Research Group, Center for Theoretical Biological Physics**, Rice University, Houston TX, Jan 2019 to Present
- Identify therapeutic targets and propose experimental studies with collaborators based on our results of coupling the cancer gene regulatory networks of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and glucose metabolism. 
- Develop stochastic models of the Notch signaling pathway and analyze results by applying condensed matter and machine learning tools to elucidate pattern formation in the Notch Signaling pathway.
- Improve accuracy of stemness regulatory network model by including binding and transcriptional regulation. Validate accuracy by comparing simulated gene expression data to experimental results.

**Pettitt Research Group**, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston TX, Summer 2018 and 2016
- Collaborated on development of software, in both Fortran and C++, to improve crystal structure refinement by calculating the proximal radial distribution functions (pRDFs) of proteins from molecular dynamics (using NAMD) of amino acid systems generated in VMD.
- Confirmed the solvation of myoglobin with pRDFs was consistent with all-atom molecular dynamics but had a computational cost similar to implicit solvent.

**Leadership Computing Facility**, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne IL, Summer 2017
- Decreased computational cost of electronic structure calculations by optimizing Selected Configuration Interaction (CI) wavefunctions for use in Diffusion Monte Carlo. 
- Developed <a href="https://github.com/madgal/qmcpack_input_generator">workflow</a> to generate input for QMCPACK from selected CI, Quantum Package, output.

**Madura Research Group**, Duquesne University, Pittsburgh PA, October 2014 to April 2017
- Elucidated hydration properties of side chain substitutions of a thermoresponsive polymer with applications in drug delivery.
- Developed <a href="https://github.com/madgal/VoronoiAnalysis">code to analyze hydration properties</a> using Voronoi polyhedra.
