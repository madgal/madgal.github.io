I love programming and realize that one language doesn't work for every problem. So I have learned multiple languages - Fortran, Python, Java, C, and C++. Check out some of the contributions on my main github account. My favorite language for ease of use and simplicity is Python, but Fortran, C, and C++ are great for scientific computing.
